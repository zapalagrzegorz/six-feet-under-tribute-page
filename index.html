              One of TV's most acclaimed dramas, the Emmy®- and Golden
              Globe®-winning Six Feet Under was created and executive produced
              by the Oscar®-winning writer of American Beauty, Alan Ball.
            </p>
            <p>
              Six Feet Under focuses on the cathartic journey of the Fisher
              family, whose personal trials and tribulations are played out
              against the reflective backdrop of an independent funeral home in
              LA.
            </p>
            <p>
              The series centers on Ruth Fisher and her children Nate, David,
              and Claire as they navigate life after the unexpected death of
              family patriarch Nathaniel Sr. Each character deals with love,
              loss and self discovery in a number of emotional scenarios across
              the show’s five seasons. By series’ end, each of the main
              characters will come to embrace the cycle of life -- birth, death,
              and rebirth -- in ways that are both unique and interconnected.

                "The show stars Peter Krause as Nathaniel Samuel "Nate" Fisher,
                Jr., whose funeral director father (Richard Jenkins) dies and
                bequeaths to him and his brother, David (Michael C. Hall),
                co-ownership of the family funeral business. The Fisher clan
                also includes widow, Ruth (Frances Conroy), and daughter, Claire
                (Lauren Ambrose).
              </p>

              <p>
                Other regulars include mortician and family friend, Federico
                Diaz (Freddy Rodriguez), Nate's on-again/off-again girlfriend,
                Brenda Chenowith (Rachel Griffiths), and David's long-term
                boyfriend, Keith Charles (Mathew St. Patrick).
              </p>

              <p>
                On one level, the show is a conventional family drama, dealing
                with such issues as interpersonal relationships, infidelity, and
                religion. At the same time, the show is distinguished by its
                unblinking focus on the topic of death, which it explores on
                multiple levels (personal, religious, and philosophical). Each
                episode begins with a death – the cause of which ranges from
                heart attack or murder to sudden infant death syndrome – and
                that death usually sets the thematic tone for each episode,
                allowing the characters to reflect on their current fortunes and
                misfortunes in a way that is illuminated by the death and its
                aftermath. The show also utilises dark humor and surrealism
                running throughout.
              </p>

              <p>
                A recurring plot device consists of a character having an
                imaginary conversation with the deceased; for example, Nate,
                David, and Federico sometimes "converse" with the decedent at
                the beginning of the episode, while the corpse is being
                embalmed, or during funeral planning or the funeral itself.
                Sometimes, the characters converse with other, recurring
                deceased characters, most notably Nathaniel Fisher, Sr. The
                show's creator, Alan Ball, avers that this represents the living
                characters' internal dialogues expressed in the form of external
                conversations.

                Nathaniel Samuel "Nate" Fisher Jr. (1965-2005) is a fictional
                character in the HBO series Six Feet Under. He is the firstborn
                of the Fisher siblings and is portrayed by Peter Krause

              <p class="text-justify">
                He was arguably the one whose life was most drastically changed
                by his father's death. Until then, he hadn't dedicated his life
                to much of anything - except, perhaps, keeping far away from his
                family. At the age of thirty-five he was a college dropout who
                hadn't had a romantic relationship that lasted longer than two
                months and the pinnacle of whose career was Assistant Manager of
                Organic Produce at Seattle's "highest-volume food co-op." When
                he inherited half of Fisher and Sons Funeral Home, Nate's first
                impulse was to sell the business to his father's archrival,
                Kroehner Service International. But he thought better of it,
                convincing his brother David that Fisher and Sons should remain
                independent, with the two of them running it. As a result, Nate
                suddenly found himself totally immersed in the family business -
                and his family.

                David James Fisher (1969-2044) is a fictional character in the
                HBO series Six Feet Under. David is the middle Fisher child. He
                is portrayed by Michael C. Hall.
              </p>
              <p>
                He is four years younger than his older brother Nate, and at the
                beginning of the series both share a strained relationship,
                mostly due to David's jealousy over Nate's escape from the
                Fisher home, as well as his 'Golden Boy' image with their
                parents, Ruth and Nathaniel Sr. This relationship soothes after
                Nate decides to stay and help out with the family business, and
                are shown to have mended their relationship by the end of Season
                1, and share a close bond by the end of Season 2 (Nate wishes
                David could come with him into surgery. They both sit together
                and later sobs over the possibility his brother might die). He
                seems to share a loving, if not a slightly strained relationship
                with his mother, Ruth. He and his father had a distant but
                loving relationship. He and Claire seem to have the closest bond
                in the family, as both often talk with each other about the
                events happening in their lives, their problems, and even once
                become high together. He also admits to Nate (who was high at
                the time) that he does like Brenda.

                Claire Simone Fisher (1983-2085) is the youngest child and only
                daughter of the Fisher family. She is portrayed by Lauren
                Ambrose.
              </p>
              <p>
                The baby of the Fisher family, Claire struggled through a
                difficult childhood and adolescence. She grew up in a house
                constantly full of people who are either dead or grieving. Her
                father was killed in a hearse/bus collision one Christmas Eve
                and she had to drive herself to the hospital high on crystal
                meth. As a result, she finds it difficult to connect with most
                people, and the prevailing opinion of her during her high school
                years was that she's a freak. On the rare occasion that she
                trusted a guy enough to have sex with him - and accede to his
                request that she suck his toes - she was greeted the next day by
                classmates' calls of "oink, oink, little piggy," and "foot
                slut."

                Ruth O'Connor Fisher (November 17, 1946–2025) is the widow of
                Nathaniel Fisher Sr. and mother of three.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ruth marries Nathaniel Fisher in 1965 after becoming pregnant
                with her first child, Nate, who is born while Nathaniel is
                serving in Vietnam. Four years later she gives birth to another
                son, David. Their third and final child, Claire, is born much
                later, in 1983. Trapped in a maternal role at a young age, Ruth
                felt resentment toward her younger sister Sarah, an artist who
                Ruth sees as a free spirit. This was worsened by an incident in
                which her son Nate lost his virginity while under his aunt
                Sarah's supervision; Ruth and Sarah were estranged for years
                afterward.

                  When I was 13 years old, I was in a car accident with my
                  sister, who was driving the car. It was her 22nd birthday, and
                  she died. She died in front of me. She died all over me. Death
                  stuck its big old ugly face in my face and my life changed.
                  That's why death seems to be a theme that appears in all my
                  stuff.

                Ball broke into television as a writer and story editor on the
                situation comedies Grace Under Fire and Cybill.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ball has written two films, American Beauty (1999) and Towelhead
                (2007), the latter of which he also produced and directed. He is
                also the creator, writer and executive producer of the HBO drama
                series Six Feet Under and True Blood. He was showrunner for True
                Blood for its first five seasons.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2010 Ball began work on a television adaptation of the crime
                noir novel The Mystic Arts of Erasing All Signs of Death by
                Charlie Huston, to be titled All Signs of Death. In December
                2010, after several months of pre-production, HBO cancelled
                production on All Signs of Death.
              </p>
              <p>
                He is also one of the executive producers of the Cinemax series
                Banshee.

                In January 2015, it was announced that Ball's period musical
                drama Virtuoso had had a pilot ordered by HBO. The pilot will be
                executively produced by Elton John. Confirmed actors to be
                starring in the show include Peter Macdissi, Iva Babic, Francois
                Civil, Lindsay Farris, Nico Mirallegro and Alex Lawther.
